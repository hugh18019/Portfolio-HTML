# Portfolio

Portfolio is the website contains information about myself including my background, my projects, and my contact information. It's continously updated to keep track of new changes and additions to my project collection as well as my other job related information.

## Installation

To view the website locally, first go into the folder called "Portfolio" that contains all the related files of the site, and make sure that the index.html file is at the root of the folder "Portfolio", and that the "assets" folder at the root contains the folders named "css" and "images". The "css" folder contains the external css file called "style.css" that is used to style the tags inside the index.html file to produce the desired look of the site. The "images" folder contains 4 images that are needed by the site. After checking that all the files are in place, simply go back to the root directory and double clicked on the index.html to view the website.

To view the published site through a browser, simply click on this link "https://hugh18019.github.io/Portfolio/".

## Technology Used

The index.html file of the project uses the Hypertext Markup Language( HTML ) to maintain a logical structure that contains all parts of the site
The style.css uses css to select tags used by the index.html file to apply styles and manipulations to them to achieve the required look and functionality and interactivity of the website.

## Main Features

The provided navigatation bar at the top of the site. Each button in the navigation bar once clicked can jump to different sections of the site to provide the user with more information that.
Each project image is a hylink by itself that links to its corresponding GitHub repo.
The layout of the site adapts to both the shrinking and enlarging of the browser window. However this feature is not completely polished as of right now.
The footer contains two links that can jump to my LinkedIn page and my GitHub page.
